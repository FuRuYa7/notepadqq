- Changing themes doesn't work entirely. The preview editor is fine, but the actual editors mess up.
- Find & Replace might behave differently. Can't search across line boundaries yet.
- Font overrides don't work yet.
- Language detection based on filename (like "Makefile") doesn't work.
- Code folding doesn't work.
- Multiple cursor selection doesn't work. Meaning "Find All" functionality doesn't work either.
- CTRL+D (duplicateSelectedBlocks) doesn't work properly.
- CTRL#L (deleteSelectedBlocks) doesn't work at line beginnings.
- ShowEOLMarkers only updates after some input action like scrolling.
- Right now there are performance issues during startup because all the expensive syntax highlighting is done at once.
